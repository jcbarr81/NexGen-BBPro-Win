==========
P0 - FIX NOW
==========
- [x] Show MLB park that they have chosen, that feature crashes UI as of now
- [x] If user has made changes to lineup or pitching rotation and has not saved, warn them if they try to close the window
- [x] Users display is not working properly, backend seems fine, but display is off
- [x] Team totals display under team stats is a little off, probably wanted to fix that
- [x] Only pitchers in LOW after creating league and no pitchers in AAA after using the auto-assign feature
- [x] Team stats pages were still lingering in the background for some reason
- [x] Closing the main screen should close all other windows as well

==========
P1 - CORE UX + LEAGUE FLOW
==========
- [x] When starting a league, remind admin to set draft settings
- [x] When opening team dashboard from admin panel, lets close the admin panel
- [x] When opening admin panel from team dashboard, close team dashboard
- [x] provide a link to the admin panel at the very bottom of the left menu
- [x] Playoff viewer link should probably be under League page
- [x] Open player dialog when double clicking from lineup or pitching staff editor
- [x] When the draft is ready, lets post some sort of messaged on the owner dashboard
- [x] Output draft results so that they are viewable for the current year and for historical years
- [x] If a human owned team makes the playoffs they should get a pop up congratulating them and letting them know that they made the post season
- [x] Revamp the player dialog to make sure that all relevant info is displayed
- [x] Player dialog opens maximized with a bottom-right close button
- [x] Make league leaders look more like the team stats pages
- [x] Dashboard console doesn't have any sorting enabled

==========
P2 - ADMIN + LONGER-TERM
==========
- [x] Turn injuries on/off and set frequency
- [x] Tutorial on creating player avatars
- [x] Tutorial on team logo generation
- [x] Revisit the ability to edit "playbalance". Make it easy to use and make sure that it has descriptions on fields and is able to be saved and changed from year to year
- Season progress, lets work on the timeline display
- [x] When creating players for the draft too many elite players are being created. Young players should have lower ratings and progress over time according to their potential ratings
- [x] Value young players more and don't cut or release them
- [x] Records and special events need to be tracked and displayed
- Eventually add individual training focus per player
- Develop workflow for online leagues so that owners can make changes and then either send updates or upload them automtically
- Add support for multiple leagues
- Further refine the UI with a better scheme and/or graphics
- Develop salary and free agency system
- Test and futher develop trading workflow, ensure trading of draft picks is enabled and tracked
- Add Hall of Fame feature
- Records, special event notifcations
